			<center><h1>	“I Will Think About It”	</center>
				<h3> "<center><p style="color:white;">	
I will think about it.” It is easy to say this, but do you know what great things have come from 
thinking?</center>

 <center><p style="color:white;">We cannot see our thoughts, or hear, 
or taste, or feel them, and yet what mighty power our thoughts have!	</center>

<center><p style="color:white;">Sir Isaac Newton was seated in his garden on a summer’s evening when he 
saw an apple fall from a tree. </center>

<center><p style="color:white;">He began to think, and, in trying to find out why the apple fell, discovered</center>
<center><p style="color:white;"> how the earth, sun, moon, and stars are kept in their places.</center>

<center><p style="color:white;">A boy named James Watt sat quietly by the fireside watching the lid
of the tea kettle as </center>
<center><p style="color:white;">it moved up and down
 He began to think: he wanted to find out why the steam in the kettle moved
he heavy lid.</center>
<center><p style="color:white;"> From that time.He went on thinking and thinking, and when he became a man,
 he improved the steam engine so</center>
<center><p style="color:white;"> much that it could do the work
of many horses with the greatest ease.

When you see a steamboat, a steam </center>
 <center><p style="color:white;">mill or a locomotive,remember that it would never have been built if it had not
 been for the hard thinking of someone.</center>

<center><p style="color:white;">A man named Galileo was once standing in the cathedral of Pisa when he saw a chandelier swaying to and from.
</center>
 <center><p style="color:white;">This set him thinking, and it led to the invention of the pendulum.

James Ferguson was a poor Scottish shepherd boy.</center> 
<center><p style="color:white;">Once, seeing the inside of a watch, he was filled with wonder.</center>
