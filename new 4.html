				Mrs. Lindsey was everyone’s favorite teacher at Lincoln Elementary School.</center>
				<h3> <center> <p style="color:white;">	he was known for her entertaining teaching techniques.One day she walked into the classroom and announced </center>
				<h3><center> <p style="color:white;"> to the class that they would all be seeing stars in their futures. She then asked. Does anyone know what astronomy is?</center>
				<br></br>
				<h3><center> <p style="color:white;">	Olivia raised her hand and said, “I’m a Libra.”</center>
				<h3> <center><p style="color:white;">	 “I can understand why you would think that astrological signs are Mrs. Lindsey responded </center>
				<h3> <center><p style="color:white;">	part of astronomy because astrology and astronomy both deal with celestial beings. In fact, </center>
				<h3><center> <p style="color:white;">	many of the constellations in the sky have given their names to astrological signs” </center>
				<h3><center> <p style="color:white;">	Mrs. Lindsey then went on to explain that astrology is the belief that the location and </center>
				<h3><center> <p style="color:white;">	movement of stars and planets affect the way events transpire on earth, which is why </center>
				<h3><center><p style="color:white;">	horoscopes are based on astrological signs. Astronomy, however, is a branch of science </center></center>
<h3><center><p style="color:white;">that deals with celestial bodies. The universe as a whole and space. “We are going to be </center>
<h3><center><p style="color:white;">learning about astronomy in this unit, and that is why you will be seeing stars in your future.”</center>
<br></br>
<h3><center><p style="color:white;">“I love looking at the stars at night,” said Olivia.</center>
<h3><center><p style="color:white;">When Mrs. Lindsey asked who else liked looking at stars. Everyone in the class raised their hands. She</center>
<h3><center><p style="color:white;">Then passed out star charts and asked the class to look at the sky that night and record the visible constellations.</center>
<h3><center><p style="color:white;">The next day in class, everyone was super excited to share their observations.</center>

<h3><center><p style="color:white;">I saw Ursa Minor, announced Andrew enthusiastically.</center>
<h3><center><p style="color:white;">So did . Said Olivia. “It looks like a dot-to-dot ladle.</center>
