				<center><h3> <p style="color:white;"> Many people associate "pirates" with buried treasure and maps marked with X. Yet </center>	
		<center><h3> <p style="color:white;">it’s not likely that most pirates hid large amounts of gold. Real pirates didn’t depict</center>
		<center><h3> <p style="color:white;">hiding places with X on maps either. How did these ideas become part of our folklore? The</center>
		<center><h3> <p style="color:white;">answer is Robert Louis Stevenson’s captivating novel Treasure Island.</center>
		<center><h3> <p style="color:white;">Appropriately, Treasure Island began with a map of an island. Stevenson painted the map</center> 
		<center><h3> <p style="color:white;">with his stepson. They made an X to show where to find buried treasure. Soon, a tale of </center>
		<center><h3> <p style="color:white;">treasure and ruthless pirates formed in Stevenson’s mind. The map was an integral part of the story.</center>
		<br></br>
		<center><h3> <p style="color:white;">Stevenson began writing his book. He used some facts about pirates. Other ideas came </center>
		<center><h3> <p style="color:white;">from his imagination, books he read, and people he knew. One of the novel's </center>
		<center><h3> <p style="color:white;">characters is a one-legged pirate, the notorious Long John Silver. Stevenson based this </center>
			<center><h3> <p style="color:white;">character partly on a one-legged friend. To make Long John more interesting, Stevenson </center>
				<center><h3> <p style="color:white;">put a pet parrot on his shoulder.</center>
					<center><h3> <p style="color:white;">Treasure Island became a classic’. Generations of readers internalized Stevenson’s </center>
						<center><h3> <p style="color:white;">image of pirates. This image made its way into other works too. Some people think it </center>
							<center><h3> <p style="color:white;">shaped perceptions of pirates more than pirate history did.</center><br><br><br>
