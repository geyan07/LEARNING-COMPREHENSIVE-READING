	<center><h3> <p style="color:white;">our bit, too. We had a chauffeur killed last week. We paid for him right off without demur, </center>
	<center><h3> <p style="color:white;">waived all question of who killed him. I never signed a check (as I took occasion to say in a </center>
	<center><h3> <p style="color:white;">little note I wrote to his people) with greater pleasure."</center>
	<center><h3> <p style="color:white;">"What do you do if Henry's mutilated?" asked Mr. Spugg, turning his quiet eyes on the </center>
	<center><h3> <p style="color:white;">insurance man and facing the brutal facts of things without flinching. "What do you pay? </center>
	<center><h3> <p style="color:white;">Suppose I lose the use of Henry's legs, what then?"</center>
	<center><h3> <p style="color:white;">"It's all right," said his friend. "Leave it to us. Whatever he loses, we make it good."</center>
	<center><h3> <p style="color:white;">"All right," said Spugg, "send me round a policy. I'm going to see Henry clear through on this."</center>
	<center><h3> <p style="color:white;">"Right away. I want him in the firing line just as quick It was at this point that at my own </center>
		<center><h3> <p style="color:white;">urgent request I was as I can get him there."</center>
<center><h3> <p style="color:white;">"It's a fine thing you're doing, Spugg," said a third member, "but do you realize that your </center>
<center><h3> <p style="color:white;">chauffeur may be killed?"</center>
<center><h3> <p style="color:white;">"I must take my chance on that," answered Mr. Spugg, firmly. "I've thought this thing out </center>
<center><h3> <p style="color:white;">and made up my mind: If my chauffeur is killed, I mean to pay for him, -full and adequate</center>
<center><h3> <p style="color:white;">compensation. The loss must fall on me, not on him. Or, say Henry comes back mutilated, </center>
<center><h3> <p style="color:white;">â€”say he loses a leg, say he loses two legs..."</center>
<center><h3> <p style="color:white;">Here Mr. Spugg looked about him at his listeners, with a look that meant that even three </center>
<center><h3> <p style="color:white;">legs wouldn't be too much for him.</center>
