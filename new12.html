<center><h3> <p style="color:white;">"Whatever Henry loses I pay for. The loss shall fall on me, every cent of it."</center>
<center><h3> <p style="color:white;">"Spugg," said a quiet-looking, neatly dressed man whom I knew to be the president of an </center>
<center><h3> <p style="color:white;">insurance company and who reached out and shook the speaker</center>
<center><h3> <p style="color:white;">introduced to Mr. Spugg, so that I might add my congratulations to those of the others. I </center>
<center><h3> <p style="color:white;">told him that I felt, as all the other members of the club did, that he was doing a big thing, </center>
<center><h3> <p style="color:white;">and he answered again, in his modest way that he didn't see what else a man could do.</center>
<center><h3> <p style="color:white;">	"My son Alfred and I," he said, "talked it over last night and we agreed that we can run the </center>		
<center><h3> <p style="color:white;">car ourselves, or make a shot at it anyway. After all, it's war time."</center>
<center><h3> <p style="color:white;">"What branch of the service are you putting your chauffeur in?" I asked.</center>
<center><h3> <p style="color:white;">"I'm not sure," he answered, "I think I'll send him up in the air. It's dangerous,."</center>

<center><h3> <p style="color:white;">of course, but it's no time to think about that</center><br>
